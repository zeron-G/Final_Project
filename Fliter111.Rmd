## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# Load the necessary libraries
library(tidyquant)
library(forecast)

# Download the NASDAQ Composite Index data
data <- tq_get("^IXIC", from = "1995-02-21")

# The data is downloaded as a data frame
# We'll use the adjusted closing prices
str(data)
data <- data$adjusted

# Fit an ARIMA model
model <- auto.arima(data)

# Print the summary of the model
print(summary(model))

# Create a data frame to hold the AIC for each year
aic_values <- data.frame(Year = integer(), AIC = numeric())

# For each year from 1995 to the current year
for (year in 1995:format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")) {
  
  # Extract the data for this year
  yearly_data <- window(data, start = as.Date(paste(year, "01", "01", sep = "-")),
                              end = as.Date(paste(year, "12", "31", sep = "-")))
  
  # Skip years with no data
  if (length(yearly_data) == 0) next
  
  # Fit an ARIMA model
  model <- auto.arima(yearly_data)
  
  # Save the AIC of the model for this year
  aic_values <- rbind(aic_values, data.frame(Year = year, AIC = model$aic))
}

# Print the AIC for each year
print(aic_values)

# Print the year with the lowest AIC
print(aic_values[which.min(aic_values$AIC),])
```
